## ü§î Why DevDocs?

### The Problem
Documentation is everywhere and LLMs are OUTDATED in their knowledge. Reading it, understanding it, and implementing it takes weeks of research and development even for senior engineers. **We cut down that time to hours.**

### Our Solution
DevDocs brings documentation to you. Point it at any tech documentation URL, and watch as it:
1. Discovers all related pages to that technology
2. Extracts meaningful content without the fluff
3. Organizes information logically inside an MCP server ready for your LLM to query
4. Presents it in a clean, searchable format in MD or JSON for finetuning LLM purpose

üî• We want anyone in the world to have the ability to build amazing products quickly using the most cutting edge LLM technology.

## üöÄ Getting Started

We made using DevDocs extremely easy, no complex documentation to learn DevDocs. (UI is very intuitive and self learning)

<ins>Mac & Linux(WSL) Users</ins>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cyberagiinc/DevDocs.git

# Install all good stuff
cd DevDocs
./fast-markdown-mcp/setup.sh

# Run Devdocs, (next time just run ./start.sh as all requirements are already installed)
./start.sh

#logs are located under /logs for 
backend.log 
frontend.log 
mcp.log
```

Visit `http://localhost:3001` and start scraping and discovering documents!

<ins>Windows Users</ins>

#### Option 1: Using Batch Scripts (Command Prompt)

1. Run the setup script:
   ```
   fast-markdown-mcp\setup.bat
   ```

2. Start all services:
   ```
   start.bat
   ```

#### Option 2: Using PowerShell Script

1. First, run the setup batch script:
   ```
   fast-markdown-mcp\setup.bat
   ```

2. Then start all services using PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   .\start.ps1
   ```

   Note: If you encounter execution policy restrictions, you may need to run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
   ```

#### Option 3: Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

If you prefer a Linux-like environment on Windows:

1. Install WSL by following the [official instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Open a WSL terminal
3. Navigate to your project directory
4. Run the original Linux scripts:
   ```bash
   ./fast-markdown-mcp/setup.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

## üåç Built for Developers, by Developers

DevDocs is more than a tool‚Äîit's your documentation companion that:
- **Saves Time**: Turn weeks of research into hours
- **Improves Understanding**: Get clean, organized documentation
- **Enables Innovation**: Build faster with any technology
- **Supports Teams**: Share knowledge efficiently
- **LLM READY**: Modern times require modern solutions, using devdocs with LLM is extremely easy and intuitive. With minimal configuration you can run Devdocs and Claude App and  recognizes DevDocs's MCP server ready to chat with your data. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Cline/Roo Cline for Rapid software development.

1. **Open the "Modes" Interface**  
   - In **Roo Code**, click the **+** to create a new Mode-Specific Prompts.
2. **Name**  
   - Give the mode a **Name** (e.g., `Research_MCP`).  
3. **Role Definition Prompt**
```
Expertise and Personality: Expertise: Developer documentation retrieval, technical synthesis, and documentation search. Personality: Systematic, detail-oriented, and precise. Provide well-structured answers with clear references to documentation sections.

Behavioral Mandate: Always use the Table Of Contents and Section Access tools when addressing any query regarding the MCP documentation. Maintain clarity, accuracy, and traceability in your responses.
```
4. **Mode-Specific Custom Instructions Prompt**
```
1. Table Of Contents Tool: Returns a full or filtered list of documentation topics. 
2. Section Access Tool: Retrieves the detailed content of specific documentation sections.

General Process: Query Interpretation: Parse the user's query to extract key topics, keywords, and context. Identify the likely relevant sections (e.g., API configurations, error handling) from the query.

Discovery via Table Of Contents: Use the Table Of Contents tool to search the documentation index for relevant sections. Filter or scan titles and metadata for matching keywords.

Drill-Down Using Section Access: For each identified relevant document or section, use the Section Access tool to retrieve its content. If multiple parts are needed, request all related sections to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Synthesis and Response Formation: Combine the retrieved content into a coherent and complete answer. Reference section identifiers or document paths for traceability. Validate that every aspect of the query has been addressed.

Error Handling: If no matching sections are found, adjust the search parameters and retry. Clearly report if the query remains ambiguous or if no relevant documentation is available.

Mandatory Tool Usage: 
Enforcement: Every time a query is received that requires information from the MCP server docs, the agent MUST first query the Table Of Contents tool to list potential relevant topics, then use the Section Access tool to retrieve the necessary detailed content.

Search & Retrieve Workflow: 
Interpret and Isolate: Identify the key terms and data points from the user's query.

Index Lookup: Immediately query the Table Of Contents tool to obtain a list of relevant documentation sections.

Targeted Retrieval: For each promising section, use the Section Access tool to get complete content.

Information Synthesis: Merge the retrieved content, ensuring all necessary details are included and clearly referenced.

Fallback and Clarification: If initial searches yield insufficient data, adjust the query parameters and retrieve additional sections as needed.

Custom Instruction Loading: Additional custom instructions specific to Research_MCP mode may be loaded from the .clinerules-research-mcp file in your workspace. These may include further refinements or constraints based on evolving documentation structures or query types.

Final Output Construction: The final answer should be organized, directly address the query, and include clear pointers (e.g., section names or identifiers) back to the MCP documentation. Ensure minimal redundancy while covering all necessary details.
