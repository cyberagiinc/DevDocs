# Feature: Fix Discovered Pages UI Bugs - Completed

**Goal:** Resolve UI issues related to crawl status icon updates and checkbox selection state in the "Discovered Pages" section.

**Status:** `Completed`

**Tasks:**

1.  [x] **Analyze Code:**
    *   [x] Read `components/DiscoveredFiles.tsx`.
    *   [x] Read `components/CrawlStatusMonitor.tsx`.
    *   [x] Read `app/page.tsx`.
    *   [x] Read `lib/types.ts` (Implicitly).
    *   [x] Read `lib/crawl-service.ts` (Implicitly).
    *   [x] Read `backend/app/main.py`.
    *   [x] Read `backend/app/status_manager.py`.
    *   [x] Read `backend/app/crawler.py`.
2.  [x] **Propose Solutions:**
    *   [x] Identified potential causes for status icon update failure (Component rendering / Polling cleanup / Backend API / Status Manager / Crawler Logic / **Concurrency**).
    *   [x] Proposed solutions: Frontend logging, Backend check (`curl`), Cleanup redundant polling, Investigate Backend API, Investigate Status Manager, Modify Crawler Logic, **Refactor State Management**.
    *   [x] Identified potential causes for checkbox state display failure (CSS / State propagation / Conditional logic / Backend API / Status Manager / Crawler Logic / **Concurrency**).
    *   [x] Proposed solutions: Simplify CSS, State logging, Use UI library component, Fix conditional logic, Investigate Backend API, Investigate Status Manager, Modify Crawler Logic, **Refactor State Management**.
3.  [x] **Implement Fixes & Diagnosis (Iterative):**
    *   [x] **Bug 1 (Status Icon - Step 1: Logging):** Add `console.log` in `app/page.tsx` polling logic. (Done)
    *   [x] **Bug 2 (Checkbox - Step 1: Simplify CSS):** Modify `CrawlStatusMonitor.tsx` CSS. (Done)
    *   [x] **User Test Round 1:** Tested. Logs show status data propagates correctly. Status icon still fails. Checkboxes for *pending* URLs incorrectly turn grey when *overall* job completes. Polling 404s identified in `CrawlStatusMonitor`.
    *   [x] **Bug 1 (Status Icon - Step 2: Refine Logging & Cleanup):** Add logging *inside* the `map` function in `CrawlStatusMonitor.tsx`. Remove redundant polling `useEffect` hooks. (Done)
    *   [x] **Bug 2 (Checkbox - Step 2: Logic Fix & State Logging):** Adjust conditional logic for checkbox `disabled` state and visual appearance. Add `console.log` in `handleCheckboxChange`. (Done)
    *   [x] **User Test Round 2:** Tested. Checkbox active state logic fixed. Status icon and checkbox *completed* state still fail.
    *   [x] **Backend API Investigation:** Read `backend/app/main.py`. (Done - API seems okay).
    *   [x] **Status Manager Investigation:** Read `backend/app/status_manager.py`. (Done - Module logic seems okay).
    *   [x] **Crawler Investigation:** Read `backend/app/crawler.py`. (Done - Crawler *is* calling `update_url_status`).
    *   [x] **Root Cause Identified:** Failure likely due to **concurrency issues** with the global `crawl_jobs` dictionary in `status_manager.py` not being shared correctly between background tasks and API request handlers.
    *   [x] **Refactor State Management:** Modify `status_manager.py` to use a dictionary from `multiprocessing.Manager` for process-safe state sharing. (Done - *Note: This backend fix was ultimately superseded by a frontend refactor*)
    *   [x] **User Test Round 3:** Request user test after applying backend state management fix. (Completed via frontend refactor)
4.  [x] **Verify and Complete:**
    *   [x] Confirm changes address both the status icon and checkbox issues.
    *   [x] Use `attempt_completion` to summarize the fix/findings.
5.  [x] **Seal Task (Requires User Confirmation):**
    *   [x] Mark all tasks as complete and seal the feature upon user confirmation.

**Resolution:** The UI bugs related to status icons and checkbox states were ultimately resolved by refactoring the frontend. This involved creating a new `CrawlUrls` component to manage the display and state of individual URLs and updating the `CrawlStatusMonitor` component. This approach addressed the rendering and state propagation issues observed in the UI.
