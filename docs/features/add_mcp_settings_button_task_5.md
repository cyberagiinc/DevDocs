# Task List: Feature - Add MCP Settings Button - Task 5: Styling and Refinement

**Feature:** Add MCP Settings Button and Popover
**Task:** Task 5: Styling and Refinement

**Objective:** Ensure the MCP Settings button and popover UI elements are visually consistent, well-aligned, and properly formatted according to the application's style guide and surrounding components.

**Subtasks:**

1.  [x] **Create Task List File:** Create this markdown file (`docs/features/add_mcp_settings_button_task_5.md`).
2.  [ ] **Review `app/page.tsx`:**
    *   Read the file content.
    *   Locate the `MCPSettingsPopover` trigger button.
    *   Analyze its placement relative to `JobStatsSummary`.
    *   Identify the styling (variant, size) of nearby control buttons (e.g., Crawl Queue Info button) for comparison.
3.  [ ] **Review `components/MCPSettingsPopover.tsx`:**
    *   Read the file content.
    *   Examine the styling of the `<pre><code>` block for JSON display.
    *   Check the `ScrollArea` styling and height.
    *   Verify the visual presentation of loading and error states (spacing, clarity).
    *   Assess overall padding and spacing within the popover content.
4.  [ ] **Assess Responsiveness (Conceptual):** Briefly consider if the popover content structure is likely to adapt reasonably to smaller viewports based on Shadcn/Tailwind usage.
5.  [ ] **Identify Necessary Changes:** Based on reviews, determine if any CSS class additions/modifications or layout adjustments are needed in either file.
6.  [ ] **Propose Solutions & Confidence:**
    *   If changes are needed, propose specific adjustments (e.g., Tailwind classes, flexbox layout).
    *   Provide options if applicable.
    *   State confidence level (1-10) that the proposed solution (or stating no changes are needed) is appropriate.
7.  [ ] **Apply Changes (if needed):** Use the `apply_diff` tool to implement the identified styling adjustments.
8.  [ ] **Attempt Completion:** Use the `attempt_completion` tool, summarizing the outcome (changes made or confirmation of adequacy) and stating the next step (Task 6: User Testing).
9.  [ ] **Seal Task:** (Requires user confirmation) Mark this task as complete once the user confirms the styling is satisfactory.
