# BUG: Consolidated Files List Not Updating Consistently

**Goal:** Investigate and fix potential issues causing the "Consolidated Files" list in the UI to not update reliably for all users after new files are generated by a crawl.

**Status:** Investigation Pending

**Symptoms:**
*   User A completes a crawl, generating new consolidated files in `storage/markdown`.
*   User A sees the updated file list in the `ConsolidatedFiles` component.
*   User B (or potentially User A after a delay/refresh) does not see the updated file list immediately or consistently.

**Potential Areas:**
*   Frontend component `components/ConsolidatedFiles.tsx`: How does it fetch the file list? Is there polling? Is the polling interval appropriate? Is state updated correctly?
*   API endpoint `app/api/all-files/route.ts`: Does it reliably read the current contents of `storage/markdown`? Are there any server-side caching issues?
*   Browser Caching: Could aggressive browser caching prevent fetching the latest list?
*   State Management: Is the fetched file list state managed correctly and triggering re-renders?

**Plan:**
1.  Delegate investigation to Debug mode.
2.  Debug mode to examine `components/ConsolidatedFiles.tsx` and `app/api/all-files/route.ts`.
3.  Analyze the data fetching mechanism (polling, manual refresh, etc.).
4.  Check for potential caching issues (browser, server-side API).
5.  Verify backend API correctly lists files.
6.  Implement necessary fixes to ensure reliable and timely updates for all users.

**History:**
*   **[Timestamp]**: User reported inconsistent updates for the Consolidated Files list. Bug tracking file created.
