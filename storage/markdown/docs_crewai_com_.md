### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files ( and ) should match the method names in
your Python code. For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks
from file. This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your
configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won‚Äôt recognize the
reference properly.

Note how we use the same name for the agent in the () file as the method name in
the () file.

```

   Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary

   You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report

```

Note how we use the same name for the agent in the () file as the method name in
the () file.

```

   Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary

   A 5 bullet point summary of the email

```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the file.

Here are examples of how to use each annotation in your CrewAI project, and when
you should use them:

Used to define an agent in your crew. Use this when:

  * You need to create a specialized AI agent with a specific role
  * You want the agent to be automatically collected and managed by the crew
  * You need to reuse the same agent configuration across multiple tasks

```

    goal"Conduct thorough research on given topics"
    backstory"Expert researcher with years of experience in data analysis"

```

Used to define a task that can be executed by agents. Use this when:

  * You need to define a specific piece of work for an agent
  * You want tasks to be automatically sequenced and managed
  * You need to establish dependencies between different tasks

```

    description"Research the latest developments in AI technology"
    expected_output"A comprehensive report on AI advancements"

```

Used to define your crew configuration. Use this when:

  * You want to automatically collect all @agent and @task definitions
  * You need to specify how tasks should be processed (sequential or hierarchical)
  * You want to set up crew-wide configurations

```

    agentsselfagents # Automatically collected from @agent methods
    tasksselftasks  # Automatically collected from @task methods

```

Used to create custom tools for your agents. Use this when:

  * You need to give agents specific capabilities (like web search, data analysis)
  * You want to encapsulate external API calls or complex operations
  * You need to share functionality across multiple agents

```

    max_results Maximum number of results to 

  # Implement your search logic here

```

Used to execute logic before the crew starts. Use this when:

  * You need to validate or preprocess input data
  * You want to set up resources or configurations before execution
  * You need to perform any initialization logic

```

  """Validate and preprocess inputs before the crew starts."""

    

  

```

Used to process results after the crew completes. Use this when:

  * You need to format or transform the final output
  * You want to perform cleanup operations
  * You need to save or log the results in a specific way

```

  """Process and format the results after the crew completes."""

  

```

Used to handle events during crew execution. Use this when:

  * You need to monitor task progress
  * You want to log intermediate results
  * You need to implement custom progress tracking or metrics

```

  """Log task completion details for monitoring."""

```

Used to implement custom caching for task results. Use this when:

  * You want to avoid redundant expensive operations
  * You need to implement custom cache storage or expiration logic
  * You want to persist results between runs

```

  """Custom cache implementation for storing task results."""

  

      # Check if cache is still valid (e.g., not expired)

```

These decorators are part of the CrewAI framework and help organize your crew‚Äôs
structure by automatically collecting agents, tasks, and handling various
lifecycle events. They should be used within a class decorated with .

### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the
last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

Replace with the ID of the task you want to replay.

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do
so by calling the reset memory feature:

This will clear the crew‚Äôs memory, allowing for a fresh start.

The easiest way to deploy your crew is through CrewAI Enterprise, where you can
deploy your crew in a few clicks.

In the CrewAI framework, an is an autonomous unit that can:

  * Make decisions based on its role and goal
  * Use tools to accomplish objectives
  * Communicate and collaborate with other agents

Think of an agent as a specialized team member with specific skills, expertise,
and responsibilities. For example, a agent might excel at gathering and
analyzing information, while a agent might be better at creating content.

Defines the agent‚Äôs function and expertise within the crew.  
---  
The individual objective that guides the agent‚Äôs decision-making.  
Provides context and personality to the agent, enriching interactions.  
Language model that powers the agent. Defaults to the model specified in or
‚Äúgpt-4‚Äù.  
Capabilities or functions available to the agent. Defaults to an empty list.  
Language model for tool calling, overrides crew‚Äôs LLM if specified.  
Maximum iterations before the agent must provide its best answer. Default is 20.  
Maximum requests per minute to avoid rate limits.  
Maximum time (in seconds) for task execution.  
Whether the agent should maintain memory of interactions. Default is True.  
Enable detailed execution logs for debugging. Default is False.

‚Äòsafe‚Äô.  
Configuration for the embedder used by the agent.  
Knowledge sources available to the agent.  
Whether to use system prompt (for o1 model support). Default is True.  
There are two ways to create agents in CrewAI: using or defining them .

Using YAML configuration provides a cleaner, more maintainable way to define
agents. We strongly recommend using this approach in your CrewAI projects.

After creating your CrewAI project as outlined in the section, navigate to the
file and modify the template to match your requirements.

Variables in your YAML files (like ) will be replaced with values from your
inputs when running the crew:

Here‚Äôs an example of how to configure agents using YAML:

```

  You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest

  developments in topic. Known for your ability to find the most relevant

  information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

  Create detailed reports based on topic data analysis and research findings

  You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for

  your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports making

  it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.

```

To use this YAML configuration in your code, create a crew class that inherits
from :

The names you use in your YAML files () should match the method names in your
Python code.

You can create agents directly in code by instantiating the class. Here‚Äôs a
comprehensive example showing all available parameters:

```

# Create an agent with all available parameters

  goal"Analyze and interpret complex datasets to provide actionable insights"

  backstory"With over 10 years of experience in data science and machine
learning, "

       "you excel at finding patterns in complex datasets."
  llm # Default: OPENAI_MODEL_NAME or "gpt-4"

  function_calling_llm # Optional: Separate LLM for tool calling

  max_rpm # Optional: Rate limit for API calls

  max_execution_time # Optional: Maximum execution time in seconds

  max_retry_limit # Default: 2 retries on error

  code_execution_mode # Default: "safe" (options: "safe", "unsafe")

  toolsSerperDevTool # Optional: List of tools

  knowledge_sources # Optional: List of knowledge sources

  embedder_config # Optional: Custom embedder configuration

  system_template # Optional: Custom system prompt template

  prompt_template # Optional: Custom prompt template

  response_template # Optional: Custom response template

  step_callback # Optional: Callback function for monitoring

```

Let‚Äôs break down some key parameter combinations for common use cases:

```

  goal"Find and summarize information about specific topics"

  backstory"You are an experienced researcher with attention to detail"

  verbose # Enable logging for debugging

```

```

  goal"Write and debug Python code"

  backstory"Expert Python developer with 10 years of experience"

  code_execution_mode # Uses Docker for safety

  max_retry_limit # More retries for complex code tasks

```

```

  goal"Perform deep analysis of large datasets"

  backstory"Specialized in big data analysis and pattern recognition"

  function_calling_llm # Cheaper model for tool calls

```

```

  goal"Assist customers with their inquiries"

  backstory"Experienced in customer support with a focus on satisfaction"

```

  * , , and are required and shape the agent‚Äôs behavior
  * determines the language model used (default: OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4)

  * : Enable to maintain conversation history
  * : Prevents token limit issues
  * : Add domain-specific knowledge bases

  * : Maximum attempts before giving best answer
  * : Rate limiting for API calls

  * : Must be True to run code
  * : 
    * : Uses Docker (recommended for production)
    * : Direct execution (use only in trusted environments)

  * : Defines agent‚Äôs core behavior

When using custom templates, you can use variables like , , and in your
templates. These will be automatically populated during execution.

Agents can be equipped with various tools to enhance their capabilities. CrewAI
supports tools from:

Here‚Äôs how to add tools to an agent:

```

# Add tools to agent

  goal"Research the latest AI developments"

```

Agents can maintain memory of their interactions and use context from previous
tasks. This is particularly useful for complex workflows where information needs
to be retained across multiple tasks.

```

  goal"Analyze and remember complex data patterns"

```

When is enabled, the agent will maintain context across multiple interactions,
improving its ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks.

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

  * When using , be cautious with user input and always validate it
  * Use (Docker) in production environments
  * Consider setting appropriate limits to prevent infinite loops

  * Use to prevent token limit issues
  * Set appropriate to avoid rate limiting
  * Enable to improve performance for repetitive tasks

  * Use for tasks requiring historical context
  * Configure when using custom embedding models
  * Use custom templates (, , ) for fine-grained control over agent behavior

  * Enable when agents need to work together
  * Use to monitor and log agent interactions
  * Consider using different LLMs for different purposes: 

  * Set for older models that don‚Äôt support system messages
  * Ensure your chosen supports the features you need (like function calling)

  1. : If you‚Äôre hitting API rate limits:
     * Use caching for repetitive operations
  2. : If you‚Äôre exceeding context limits:
  3. : If code execution fails:
     * Verify Docker is installed for safe mode
  4. : If agent responses seem inconsistent:

Remember that agents are most effective when configured according to their
specific use case. Take time to understand your requirements and adjust these
parameters accordingly.

In the CrewAI framework, a is a specific assignment completed by an .

Tasks provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, the
agent responsible, required tools, and more, facilitating a wide range of action
complexities.

Tasks within CrewAI can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work
together. This is managed through the task properties and orchestrated by the
Crew‚Äôs process, enhancing teamwork and efficiency.

Tasks can be executed in two ways:

  * : Tasks are executed in the order they are defined
  * : Tasks are assigned to agents based on their roles and expertise

The execution flow is defined when creating the crew:

A clear, concise statement of what the task entails.  
---  
A detailed description of what the task‚Äôs completion looks like.  
A name identifier for the task.  
The agent responsible for executing the task.  
The tools/resources the agent is limited to use for this task.  
Other tasks whose outputs will be used as context for this task.  
Whether the task should be executed asynchronously. Defaults to False.  
File path for storing the task output.  
A Pydantic model to structure the JSON output.  
A Pydantic model for task output.  
Function/object to be executed after task completion.  
There are two ways to create tasks in CrewAI: using or defining them .

Using YAML configuration provides a cleaner, more maintainable way to define

Variables in your YAML files (like ) will be replaced with values from your
inputs when running the crew:

Here‚Äôs an example of how to configure tasks using YAML:

```

  Conduct a thorough research about topic

  Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given

  the current year is 2024.

  A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about topic

  Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a
report.

  Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant
information.

  A fully fledge reports with the mains topics each with a full section of
information.

  Formatted as markdown without '```'

```

To use this YAML configuration in your code, create a crew class that inherits
from :

The names you use in your YAML files ( and ) should match the method names in
your Python code.

Alternatively, you can define tasks directly in your code without using YAML
configuration:

```

    Conduct a thorough research about AI Agents
    Make sure you find  interesting  relevant information given

    A    bullet points of the most relevant information about AI Agents

    Review the context you got  expand each topic into a full section  a report
    Make sure the report  detailed  contains    relevant information

    A fully fledge reports  the mains topics each  a full section of information

```

Directly specify an for assignment or let the CrewAI‚Äôs process decide based on
roles, availability, etc.

Understanding task outputs is crucial for building effective AI workflows.
CrewAI provides a structured way to handle task results through the class, which
supports multiple output formats and can be easily passed between tasks.

The output of a task in CrewAI framework is encapsulated within the class. This
class provides a structured way to access results of a task, including various
formats such as raw output, JSON, and Pydantic models.

By default, the will only include the output. A will only include the or output
if the original object was configured with or , respectively.

Summary of the task, auto-generated from the first 10 words of the description.  
---  
The raw output of the task. This is the default format for the output.  
A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the task.  
A dictionary representing the JSON output of the task.  
The agent that executed the task.  
The format of the task output, with options including RAW, JSON, and Pydantic.
The default is RAW.  
Returns the JSON string representation of the task output if the output format
is JSON.  
---  
Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.  
Returns the string representation of the task output, prioritizing Pydantic,
then JSON, then raw.  
Once a task has been executed, its output can be accessed through the attribute
of the object. The class provides various ways to interact with and present this
output.

```

  description'Find and summarize the latest AI news'

  expected_output'A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news'

# Accessing the task output

```

Tasks can depend on the output of other tasks using the attribute. For example:

```

  description"Research the latest developments in AI"

  expected_output"A list of recent AI developments"

  description"Analyze the research findings and identify key trends"

  expected_output"Analysis report of AI trends"

  contextresearch_task # This task will wait for research_task to complete

```

Task guardrails provide a way to validate and transform task outputs before they
are passed to the next task. This feature helps ensure data quality and provides
efeedback to agents when their output doesn‚Äôt meet specific criteria.

To add a guardrail to a task, provide a validation function through the
parameter:

```

  """Validate blog content meets requirements."""

         "Blog content exceeds 200 words"

    # Additional validation logic here

  description"Write a blog post about AI"

  expected_output"A blog post under 200 words"

  guardrailvalidate_blog_content # Add the guardrail function

```

  1.      * Must accept exactly one parameter (the task output)
     * Should return a tuple of 
     * Type hints are recommended but optional
  2. 

```

```

  1. 

```

  # Step 1: Basic validation

  # Step 2: Content validation

    # Step 3: Format validation

```

When a guardrail returns :

  1. The error is sent back to the agent
  2. The agent attempts to fix the issue
  3. The process repeats until: 

```

  """Validate and parse JSON output."""

    # Try to parse as JSON

```

## Getting Structured Consistent Outputs from Tasks

It‚Äôs also important to note that the output of the final task of a crew becomes
the final output of the actual crew itself.

The property allows you to define a Pydantic model that the task output should
conform to. This ensures that the output is not only structured but also
validated according to the Pydantic model.

Here‚Äôs an example demonstrating how to use output_pydantic:

```

  goal"Generate a blog title and content"

  backstory"""You are an expert content creator, skilled in crafting engaging
and informative blog posts."""

  description"""Create a blog title and content on a given topic. Make sure the
content is under 200 words."""

  expected_output"A compelling blog title and well-written content."

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process

# Option 1: Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing

"Accessing Properties - Option 1"

# Option 2: Accessing Properties Directly from the Pydantic Model

"Accessing Properties - Option 2"

# Option 3: Accessing Properties Using the to_dict() Method

"Accessing Properties - Option 3"

# Option 4: Printing the Entire Blog Object

"Accessing Properties - Option 5"

```

  * A Pydantic model Blog is defined with title and content fields.
  * The task task1 uses the output_pydantic property to specify that its output should conform to the Blog model.
  * After executing the crew, you can access the structured output in multiple ways as shown.

#### Explanation of Accessing the Output

  1. Dictionary-Style Indexing: You can directly access the fields using result[‚Äúfield_name‚Äù]. This works because the CrewOutput class implements the method.
  2. Directly from Pydantic Model: Access the attributes directly from the result.pydantic object.
  3. Using to_dict() Method: Convert the output to a dictionary and access the fields.
  4. Printing the Entire Object: Simply print the result object to see the structured output.

The property allows you to define the expected output in JSON format. This
ensures that the task‚Äôs output is a valid JSON structure that can be easily
parsed and used in your application.

Here‚Äôs an example demonstrating how to use :

```

# Define the Pydantic model for the blog

  goal"Generate a blog title and content"

  backstory"""You are an expert content creator, skilled in crafting engaging
and informative blog posts."""

# Define the task with output_json set to the Blog model

  description"""Create a blog title and content on a given topic. Make sure the
content is under 200 words."""

  expected_output"A JSON object with 'title' and 'content' fields."

# Instantiate the crew with a sequential process

# Kickoff the crew to execute the task

# Option 1: Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing

"Accessing Properties - Option 1"

# Option 2: Printing the Entire Blog Object

"Accessing Properties - Option 2"

```

  * A Pydantic model Blog is defined with title and content fields, which is used to specify the structure of the JSON output.
  * The task task1 uses the output_json property to indicate that it expects a JSON output conforming to the Blog model.
  * After executing the crew, you can access the structured JSON output in two ways as shown.

#### Explanation of Accessing the Output

  1. Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing: You can access the fields directly using result[‚Äúfield_name‚Äù]. This is possible because the CrewOutput class implements the method, allowing you to treat the output like a dictionary. In this option, we‚Äôre retrieving the title and content from the result.
  2. Printing the Entire Blog Object: By printing result, you get the string representation of the CrewOutput object. Since the method is implemented to return the JSON output, this will display the entire output as a formatted string representing the Blog object.

By using output_pydantic or output_json, you ensure that your tasks produce
outputs in a consistent and structured format, making it easier to process and
utilize the data within your application or across multiple tasks.

Leverage tools from the and for enhanced task performance and agent interaction.

## Creating a Task with Tools

```

osenviron  

 goal'Find and summarize the latest AI news'

 backstory"You're a researcher at a large company

# to perform a semantic search for a specified query from a text's content
across the internet

 description'Find and summarize the latest AI news'

 expected_output'A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news'

```

This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent‚Äôs default
set for tailored task execution.

In CrewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one,
but you can specifically define what tasks‚Äô output, including multiple, should
be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task
that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the attribute
of the task:

```

  description"Research the latest developments in AI"

  expected_output"A list of recent AI developments"

  description"Research the latest developments in AI Ops"

  expected_output"A list of recent AI Ops developments"

  description"Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest
news"

  expected_output"Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long"

```

You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew
will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is
useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial
for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the attribute to define in a future task that it should wait
for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.

```

  description"List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI."

  expected_output"Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article."

  async_execution # Will be executed asynchronously

  description"Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important
events."

  expected_output"Bullet point list of 5 important events."

  async_execution # Will be executed asynchronously

  description"Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas."

  expected_output"A 4 paragraph article about AI."

  contextlist_ideas list_important_history # Will wait for the output of the two
tasks to be completed

```

The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for
actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task‚Äôs outcome.

```

  # Do something after the task is completed

  # Example: Send an email to the manager

  description'Find and summarize the latest AI news'

  expected_output'A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news'

```

## Accessing a Specific Task Output

Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by
using the attribute of the task object:

```

  description'Find and summarize the latest AI news'

  expected_output'A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news'

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task

```

Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities,
emphasizing CrewAI‚Äôs flexibility.

## Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms

While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place
to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but
are not limited to:

  * Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
  * Preventing the manual assignment of the attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.

These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task
executions within the crewAI framework.

Task guardrails provide a powerful way to validate, transform, or filter task
outputs before they are passed to the next task. Guardrails are optional
functions that execute before the next task starts, allowing you to ensure that
task outputs meet specific requirements or formats.

```

  """Validate that the output is valid JSON."""

      "Output must be valid JSON"

```

  1. : Guardrails are an optional attribute at the task level, allowing you to add validation only where needed.
  2. : The guardrail function is executed before the next task starts, ensuring valid data flow between tasks.
  3. : Guardrails must return a tuple of : 
  4. : 
     * On success (), the result is automatically passed to the next task
     * On failure (), the error is sent back to the agent to generate a new answer

```

  """Ensure the output contains a valid email address."""

    "Output must be a valid email address"

```

```

  """Remove or validate sensitive information."""

        f"Output contains sensitive information (

```

```

  """Ensure phone numbers are in a consistent format."""

    "Output must be a 10-digit phone number"

```

```

```

```

  max_retries # Override default retry limit

```

## Creating Directories when Saving Files

You can now specify if a task should create directories when saving its output
to a file. This is particularly useful for organizing outputs and ensuring that
file paths are correctly structured.

```

  description'Save the summarized AI news to a file'

```

Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in CrewAI. By properly
defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work
effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks
with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following
robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI‚Äôs potential,
ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks
are executed as intended.

A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to
achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent
collaboration, and the overall workflow.

A list of tasks assigned to the crew.  
---  
A list of agents that are part of the crew.  
The process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows. Default is .  
The verbosity level for logging during execution. Defaults to .  
The language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process.
**Required when using a hierarchical process.**  
If passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all
agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew‚Äôs
LLM for function calling.  
Optional configuration settings for the crew, in or format.  
Maximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution. Defaults to .  
Language used for the crew, defaults to English.  
Path to the language file to be used for the crew.  
Utilized for storing execution memories (short-term, long-term, entity memory).  
Configuration for the memory provider to be used by the crew.  
Specifies whether to use a cache for storing the results of tools‚Äô execution.
Defaults to .  
Configuration for the embedder to be used by the crew. Mostly used by memory for
now. Default is .  
Whether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just
the final output. Defaults to .  
A function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to
log the agent‚Äôs actions or to perform other operations; it won‚Äôt override the
agent-specific .  
A function that is called after the completion of each task. Useful for
monitoring or additional operations post-task execution.  
Whether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the
crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models.  
Whether you want to have a file with the complete crew output and execution. You
can set it using True and it will default to the folder you are currently in and
it will be called logs.txt or passing a string with the full path and name of
the file.  
sets a custom agent that will be used as a manager.  
Path to the prompt JSON file to be used for the crew.  
Adds planning ability to the Crew. When activated before each Crew iteration,
all Crew data is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks and this plan
will be added to each task description.  
The language model used by the AgentPlanner in a planning process.  
: The attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can
perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents‚Äô settings if
you set it.

There are two ways to create crews in CrewAI: using or defining them .

Using YAML configuration provides a cleaner, more maintainable way to define
crews and is consistent with how agents and tasks are defined in CrewAI
projects.

After creating your CrewAI project as outlined in the section, you can define
your crew in a class that inherits from and uses decorators to define agents,
tasks, and the crew itself.

#### Example Crew Class with Decorators

```

  # Paths to your YAML configuration files

  # To see an example agent and task defined in YAML, checkout the following:

    # Modify inputs before the crew starts

    # Modify output after the crew finishes

      agentsselfagents # Automatically collected by the @agent decorator
      tasksselftasks  # Automatically collected by the @task decorator. 

```

Tasks will be executed in the order they are defined.

The class, along with these decorators, automates the collection of agents and
tasks, reducing the need for manual management.

CrewAI provides several decorators in the file that are used to mark methods
within your crew class for special handling:

  * : Marks the class as a crew base class.
  * : Denotes a method that returns an object.
  * : Denotes a method that returns a object.
  * : Denotes the method that returns the object.
  * : (Optional) Marks a method to be executed before the crew starts.
  * : (Optional) Marks a method to be executed after the crew finishes.

These decorators help in organizing your crew‚Äôs structure and automatically
collecting agents and tasks without manually listing them.

Alternatively, you can define the crew directly in code without using YAML
configuration files.

```

      goal"Analyze data trends in the market"
      backstory"An experienced data analyst with a background in economics"

      goal"Gather information on market dynamics"
      backstory"A diligent researcher with a keen eye for detail"

      description"Collect recent market data and identify trends."
      expected_output"A report summarizing key trends in the market."

      description"Research factors affecting market dynamics."
      expected_output"An analysis of factors influencing the market."

```

  * Agents and tasks are defined directly within the class without decorators.
  * We manually create and manage the list of agents and tasks.
  * This approach provides more control but can be less maintainable for larger projects.

The output of a crew in the CrewAI framework is encapsulated within the class.
This class provides a structured way to access results of the crew‚Äôs execution,
including various formats such as raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models. The
includes the results from the final task output, token usage, and individual
task outputs.

The raw output of the crew. This is the default format for the output.  
---  
A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the crew.  
A dictionary representing the JSON output of the crew.  
A list of objects, each representing the output of a task in the crew.  
A summary of token usage, providing insights into the language model‚Äôs
performance during execution.  
### Crew Output Methods and Properties

Returns the JSON string representation of the crew output if the output format
is JSON.  
---  
Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.  
Returns the string representation of the crew output, prioritizing Pydantic,
then JSON, then raw.  
Once a crew has been executed, its output can be accessed through the attribute
of the object. The class provides various ways to interact with and present this
output.

```

# Accessing the crew output

```

Crews can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance
their execution and learning over time. This feature allows crews to store and
recall execution memories, aiding in decision-making and task execution
strategies.

Caches can be employed to store the results of tools‚Äô execution, making the
process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical tasks.

After the crew execution, you can access the attribute to view the language
model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides
insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.

```

# Access the crew's usage metrics

```

  * : Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
  * : A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. : A or is required for this process and it‚Äôs essential for validating the process flow.

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the method. This starts
the execution process according to the defined process flow.

```

# Start the crew's task execution

```

### Different Ways to Kick Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the appropriate kickoff
method. CrewAI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff
process: , , , and .

  * : Starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.
  * : Executes tasks for each agent individually.
  * : Initiates the workflow asynchronously.
  * : Executes tasks for each agent individually in an asynchronous manner.

```

# Start the crew's task execution

# Example of using kickoff_for_each

inputs_array  

# Example of using kickoff_async

# Example of using kickoff_for_each_async

inputs_array  

```

These methods provide flexibility in how you manage and execute tasks within
your crew, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows tailored to
your needs.

### Replaying from a Specific Task

You can now replay from a specific task using our CLI command .

The replay feature in CrewAI allows you to replay from a specific task using the
command-line interface (CLI). By running the command , you can specify the for
the replay process.

Kickoffs will now save the latest kickoffs returned task outputs locally for you
to be able to replay from.

### Replaying from a Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

  1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
  2. Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.

To view the latest kickoff task IDs, use:

Then, to replay from a specific task, use:

These commands let you replay from your latest kickoff tasks, still retaining
context from previously executed tasks.

CrewAI Flows is a powerful feature designed to streamline the creation and
management of AI workflows. Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate
coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building
sophisticated AI automations.

Flows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a
seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of
execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and
implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of CrewAI‚Äôs
capabilities.

  1. : Easily chain together multiple Crews and tasks to create complex AI workflows.
  2. : Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different tasks in your workflow.
  3. : Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.
  4. : Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.

Let‚Äôs create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city
in one task and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another task.

```

    # Each flow state automatically gets a unique ID

           "Return the name of a random city in the world."

    # Store the city in our state

           f"Tell me a fun fact about 

    # Store the fun fact in our state

```

In the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city
using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of
two tasks: and . The task is the starting point of the Flow, and the task
listens for the output of the task.

Each Flow instance automatically receives a unique identifier (UUID) in its
state, which helps track and manage flow executions. The state can also store
additional data (like the generated city and fun fact) that persists throughout
the flow‚Äôs execution.

When you run the Flow, it will:

  1. Generate a unique ID for the flow state
  2. Generate a random city and store it in the state
  3. Generate a fun fact about that city and store it in the state
  4. Print the results to the console

The state‚Äôs unique ID and stored data can be useful for tracking flow executions
and maintaining context between tasks.

Ensure you have set up your file to store your . This key is necessary for
authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.

The decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a
Flow is started, all the methods decorated with are executed in parallel. You
can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when
the Flow is started.

The decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another
task in the Flow. The method decorated with will be executed when the specified
task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is
listening to as an argument.

The decorator can be used in several ways:

  1. **Listening to a Method by Name** : You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.
  2. **Listening to a Method Directly** : You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.

Accessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI
workflows into larger applications or systems. CrewAI Flows provide
straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate
results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.

When you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that
completes. The method returns the output of this final method.

Here‚Äôs how you can access the final output:

```

```

In this example, the is the last method to complete, so its output will be the
final output of the Flow. The method will return the final output, which is then
printed to the console.

In addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the
state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between
different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state
to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.

Here‚Äôs an example of how to update and access the state:

```

    selfstatemessage  " - updated by second_method"

```

In this example, the state is updated by both and . After the Flow has run, you
can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.

By ensuring that the final method‚Äôs output is returned and providing access to
the state, CrewAI Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI
workflows into larger applications or systems, while also maintaining and
accessing the state throughout the Flow‚Äôs execution.

Managing state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI
workflows. CrewAI Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and
structured state management, allowing developers to choose the approach that
best fits their application‚Äôs needs.

In unstructured state management, all state is stored in the attribute of the
class. This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify
state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema. Even with
unstructured states, CrewAI Flows automatically generates and maintains a unique
identifier (UUID) for each state instance.

```

    # The state automatically includes an 'id' field

```

The field is automatically generated and preserved throughout the flow‚Äôs
execution. You don‚Äôt need to manage or set it manually, and it will be
maintained even when updating the state with new data.

  * You can dynamically add attributes to without predefined constraints.
  * Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.

Structured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency
and type safety across the workflow. By using models like Pydantic‚Äôs ,
developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation
and auto-completion in development environments.

Each state in CrewAI Flows automatically receives a unique identifier (UUID) to
help track and manage state instances. This ID is automatically generated and
managed by the Flow system.

```

  # Note: 'id' field is automatically added to all states

    # Access the auto-generated ID if needed

```

  * clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
  * Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.
  * IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.

### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management

  * **Use Unstructured State Management when:**
    * The workflow‚Äôs state is simple or highly dynamic.
    * Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.
    * Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.
  * **Use Structured State Management when:**
    * The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.
    * Type safety and validation are important for your application‚Äôs reliability.
    * You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.

By providing both unstructured and structured state management options, CrewAI
Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and
robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.

The function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the
listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

```

     "Hello from the start method"

     "Hello from the second method"

```

When you run this Flow, the method will be triggered by the output of either the
or the . The function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the
listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

The function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the
listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

```

    selfstate  "Hello from the start method"

    selfstate  "What do computers eat? Microchips."

```

When you run this Flow, the method will be triggered only when both the and the
emit an output. The function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger
the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

The decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on
the output of a method. You can specify different routes based on the output of
the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.

```

```

In the above example, the generates a random boolean value and sets it in the
state. The uses the decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the
value of the boolean. If the boolean is , the method returns , and if it is ,
the method returns . The and listen to the output of the and execute based on
the returned value.

When you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value
generated by the .

Creating a flow with multiple crews in CrewAI is straightforward.

You can generate a new CrewAI project that includes all the scaffolding needed
to create a flow with multiple crews by running the following command:

This command will generate a new CrewAI project with the necessary folder
structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt crew called that is already
working. You can use this crew as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it
to create other crews.

After running the command, you will see a folder structure similar to the
following:

Root directory for the flow.  
---  
Contains directories for specific crews.  
Directory for the ‚Äúpoem_crew‚Äù with its configurations and scripts.  
Configuration files directory for the ‚Äúpoem_crew‚Äù.  
YAML file defining the agents for ‚Äúpoem_crew‚Äù.  
YAML file defining the tasks for ‚Äúpoem_crew‚Äù.  
Directory for additional tools used in the flow.  
Main script for running the flow.  
Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.  
Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.  
In the folder, you can define multiple crews. Each crew will have its own folder
containing configuration files and the crew definition file. For example, the
folder contains:

  * : Defines the agents for the crew.
  * : Defines the tasks for the crew.
  * : Contains the crew definition, including agents, tasks, and the crew itself.

You can copy, paste, and edit the to create other crews.

The file is where you create your flow and connect the crews together. You can
define your flow by using the class and the decorators and to specify the flow
of execution.

Here‚Äôs an example of how you can connect the in the file:

```

```

In this example, the class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses
the to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked
off by calling the method.

(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:

Once all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual
environment by running:

After activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one
of the following commands:

The flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.

Visualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure
and execution paths of your flows. CrewAI offers a powerful visualization tool
that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to
understand and optimize your AI workflows.

Plots in CrewAI are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display
the various tasks, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This
visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying
bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.

### How to Generate a Plot

CrewAI provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:

If you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by
calling the method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file
containing the interactive plot of your flow.

```

# Assuming you have a flow instance

```

This will generate a file named in your current directory. You can open this
file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.

#### Option 2: Using the Command Line

If you are working within a structured CrewAI project, you can generate a plot
using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where
you want to visualize the entire flow setup.

This command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to
the method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open
it in a web browser to explore the flow.

The generated plot will display nodes representing the tasks in your flow, with
directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive,
allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.

By visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the
workflow‚Äôs structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your
AI processes to others.

Plotting your flows is a powerful feature of CrewAI that enhances your ability
to design and manage complex AI workflows. Whether you choose to use the method
or the command line, generating plots will provide you with a visual
representation of your workflows, aiding in both development and presentation.

If you‚Äôre interested in exploring additional examples of flows, we have a
variety of recommendations in our examples repository. Here are four specific
flow examples, each showcasing unique use cases to help you match your current
problem type to a specific example:

  1. : This example demonstrates an infinite loop where a background job continually runs to automate email responses. It‚Äôs a great use case for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly without manual intervention. 
  2. : This flow showcases adding human-in-the-loop feedback and handling different conditional branches using the router. It‚Äôs an excellent example of how to incorporate dynamic decision-making and human oversight into your workflows. 
  3. : This example excels at chaining multiple crews together, where the output of one crew is used by another. Specifically, one crew outlines an entire book, and another crew generates chapters based on the outline. Eventually, everything is connected to produce a complete book. This flow is perfect for complex, multi-step processes that require coordination between different tasks. 
  4. : This flow demonstrates how to broadcast one event to trigger multiple follow-up actions. For instance, after a meeting is completed, the flow can update a Trello board, send a Slack message, and save the results. It‚Äôs a great example of handling multiple outcomes from a single event, making it ideal for comprehensive task management and notification systems. 

By exploring these examples, you can gain insights into how to leverage CrewAI
Flows for various use cases, from automating repetitive tasks to managing
complex, multi-step processes with dynamic decision-making and human feedback.

Knowledge in CrewAI is a powerful system that allows AI agents to access and
utilize external information sources during their tasks. Think of it as giving
your agents a reference library they can consult while working.

Key benefits of using Knowledge:

  * Enhance agents with domain-specific information
  * Support decisions with real-world data
  * Ground responses in factual information

CrewAI supports various types of knowledge sources out of the box:

List of knowledge sources that provide content to be stored and queried. Can
include PDF, CSV, Excel, JSON, text files, or string content.  
---  
Name of the collection where the knowledge will be stored. Used to identify
different sets of knowledge. Defaults to ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù if not provided.  
Custom storage configuration for managing how the knowledge is stored and
retrieved. If not provided, a default storage will be created.  
For file-Based Knowledge Sources, make sure to place your files in a directory
at the root of your project. Also, use relative paths from the directory when
creating the source.

Here‚Äôs an example using string-based knowledge:

```

# Create a knowledge source

content  "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."

# Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs

# Create an agent with the knowledge store

  goal"You know everything about the user."

  backstory"""You are a master at understanding people and their preferences."""

  description"Answer the following questions about the user: {question}"

  expected_output"An answer to the question."

  knowledge_sourcesstring_source # Enable knowledge by adding the sources here.
You can also add more sources to the sources list.

result  crewkickoffinputs "What city does John live in and how old is he?"

```

Here‚Äôs another example with the . The CrewDoclingSource is actually quite
versatile and can handle multiple file formats including TXT, PDF, DOCX, HTML,
and more.

```

# Create a knowledge source

# Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs

# Create an agent with the knowledge store

  goal"You know everything about the papers."

  backstory"""You are a master at understanding papers and their content."""

  description"Answer the following questions about the papers: {question}"

  expected_output"An answer to the question."

   # Enable knowledge by adding the sources here. You can also add more sources
to the sources list.

     "What is the reward hacking paper about? Be sure to provide sources."

```

Here are examples of how to use different types of knowledge sources:

```

# Create a text file knowledge source

# Create crew with text file source on agents or crew level

```

```

# Create a PDF knowledge source

# Create crew with PDF knowledge source on agents or crew level

```

```

# Create a CSV knowledge source

# Create crew with CSV knowledge source or on agent level

```

```

# Create an Excel knowledge source

# Create crew with Excel knowledge source on agents or crew level

```

```

# Create a JSON knowledge source

# Create crew with JSON knowledge source on agents or crew level

```

Knowledge sources automatically chunk content for better processing. You can
configure chunking behavior in your knowledge sources:

```

  chunk_size   # Maximum size of each chunk (default: 4000)

  chunk_overlap   # Overlap between chunks (default: 200)

```

The chunking configuration helps in:

  * Breaking down large documents into manageable pieces
  * Maintaining context through chunk overlap

You can also configure the embedder for the knowledge store. This is useful if
you want to use a different embedder for the knowledge store than the one used
for the agents. The parameter supports various embedding model providers that
include:

  * : Google‚Äôs text embedding models
  * : Local embeddings with Ollama
  * : Google Cloud VertexAI embeddings

Here‚Äôs an example of how to configure the embedder for the knowledge store using
Google‚Äôs model:

```

# Get the GEMINI API key

# Create a knowledge source

content  "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."

# Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs

# Create an agent with the knowledge store

  goal"You know everything about the user."

  backstory"""You are a master at understanding people and their preferences."""

  description"Answer the following questions about the user: {question}"

  expected_output"An answer to the question."

result  crewkickoffinputs "What city does John live in and how old is he?"

```

If you need to clear the knowledge stored in CrewAI, you can use the command
with the option.

This is useful when you‚Äôve updated your knowledge sources and want to ensure
that the agents are using the most recent information.

While knowledge can be provided at the crew level using , individual agents can
also have their own knowledge sources using the parameter:

```

# Create agent-specific knowledge about a product

# Create a support agent with product knowledge

  goal"Provide accurate product information and support."

  backstory"You are an expert on our laptop products and specifications."

# Create a task that requires product knowledge

  description"Answer this customer question: {question}"

# Create and run the crew

# Get answer about the laptop's specifications

  inputs "What is the storage capacity of the XPS 13?"

```

  * Give agents specialized information for their roles
  * Maintain separation of concerns between agents
  * Combine with crew-level knowledge for layered information access

CrewAI allows you to create custom knowledge sources for any type of data by
extending the class. Let‚Äôs create a practical example that fetches and processes
space news articles.

#### Space News Knowledge Source Example

```

  """Knowledge source that fetches data from Space News API."""

  limit   Fielddefault description"Number of articles to fetch"

    """Fetch and format space news articles."""

       ValueErrorf"Failed to fetch space news: 

    """Format articles into readable text."""

    """Process and store the articles."""

  goal"Answer questions about space news accurately and comprehensively"

  backstory"You are a space industry analyst  expertise  space exploration

  satellite technology  space industry trends You excel at answering questions

  about space news  providing detailed accurate information"

# Create task that handles user questions

  description"Answer this question about space news: {user_question}"

  expected_output"A detailed answer based on the recent space news articles"

# Create and run the crew

  inputs "What are the latest developments in space exploration?"

```

  1.      * Configurable API endpoint and article limit
     * Implements three key methods: 
       * : Fetches articles from the API
       * : Structures the articles into readable text
       * : Processes and stores the content
  2.      * Specialized role as a Space News Analyst
     * Uses the knowledge source to access space news
  3.      * Takes a user question as input through 
     * Designed to provide detailed answers based on the knowledge source
  4.      * Manages the workflow between agent and task
     * Handles input/output through the kickoff method

This example demonstrates how to:

  * Create a custom knowledge source that fetches real-time data
  * Process and format external data for AI consumption
  * Use the knowledge source to answer specific user questions
  * Integrate everything seamlessly with CrewAI‚Äôs agent system

#### About the Spaceflight News API

The example uses the , which:

  * Provides free access to space-related news articles
  * Returns structured data about space news

You can customize the API query by modifying the endpoint URL:

```

  limit # Increase the number of articles

  api_endpoint # Search for NASA news

```

  * Keep chunk sizes appropriate for your content type
  * Consider content overlap for context preservation
  * Organize related information into separate knowledge sources

  * Adjust chunk sizes based on content complexity
  * Consider using local embedding providers for faster processing

CrewAI integrates with multiple LLM providers through LiteLLM, giving you the
flexibility to choose the right model for your specific use case. This guide
will help you understand how to configure and use different LLM providers in
your CrewAI projects.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the core intelligence behind CrewAI agents.
They enable agents to understand context, make decisions, and generate human-
like responses. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They
power the intelligence of your CrewAI agents, enabling them to understand and
generate human-like text.

The context window determines how much text an LLM can process at once. Larger
windows (e.g., 128K tokens) allow for more context but may be more expensive and
slower.

Temperature (0.0 to 1.0) controls response randomness. Lower values (e.g., 0.2)
produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (e.g., 0.8)
increase creativity and variability.

Each LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) offers different models with
varying capabilities, pricing, and features. Choose based on your needs for
accuracy, speed, and cost.

## Available Models and Their Capabilities

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of supported models and their capabilities, you can
compare performance at and :  
1 token ‚âà 4 characters in English. For example, 8,192 tokens ‚âà 32,768 characters
or about 6,000 words.

There are three ways to configure LLMs in CrewAI. Choose the method that best
fits your workflow:

The simplest way to get started. Set these variables in your environment:

```

# Required: Your API key for authentication

# Optional: Default model selection

gpt-4o-mini # Default if not set

# Optional: Organization ID (if applicable)

```

Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment files (.env) or your
system‚Äôs secret management.

Learn how to get the most out of your LLM configuration:

CrewAI includes smart context management features:

```

# 1. Token counting and tracking

# 2. Content summarization when needed

# 3. Task splitting for large contexts

```

Best practices for context management:

  1. Choose models with appropriate context windows
  2. Pre-process long inputs when possible
  3. Use chunking for large documents
  4. Monitor token usage to optimize costs

Choose the right context window for your task:

  * Small tasks (up to 4K tokens): Standard models
  * Medium tasks (between 4K-32K): Enhanced models
  * Large tasks (over 32K): Large context models

```

# Configure model with appropriate settings

  temperature  # Adjust based on task

  max_tokens  # Set based on output needs

  timeout    # Longer timeout for complex tasks

```

  * Lower temperature (0.1 to 0.3) for factual responses
  * Higher temperature (0.7 to 0.9) for creative tasks

Remember to regularly monitor your token usage and adjust your configuration as
needed to optimize costs and performance.

```

# Option 1. Gemini accessed with an API key.

# Option 2. Vertex AI IAM credentials for Gemini, Anthropic, and anything in the
Model Garden.

```

  1. Run a model: 

  * Good balance of speed and quality
  * Support for long context windows

Most authentication issues can be resolved by checking API key format and
environment variable names.

# Processes
URL: https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/processes

* [Create Your Own Manager Agent](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/</how-to/custom-manager-agent>)
  * [Force Tool Output as Result](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/</how-to/force-tool-output-as-result>)
  * [Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/</how-to/replay-tasks-from-latest-crew-kickoff>)

Processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project
management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and
executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.

  * : Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
  * : Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. A manager language model () or a custom manager agent () must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, facilitating the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
  * : Aiming for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, this process type introduces a democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. It is planned for future development and is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## The Role of Processes in Teamwork

Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining
their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

## Assigning Processes to a Crew

To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to
set the execution strategy. For a hierarchical process, ensure to define or for
the manager agent.

```

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process

# Ensure to provide a manager_llm or manager_agent

```

Ensure and are defined prior to creating a object, and for the hierarchical
process, either or is also required.

This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a
thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in
the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the parameter in the class to specify outputs
that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

Emulates a corporate hierarchy, CrewAI allows specifying a custom manager agent
or automatically creates one, requiring the specification of a manager language
model (). This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation,
and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to
agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task
completion.

The class is implemented as an enumeration (), ensuring type safety and
restricting process values to the defined types (, ). The consensual process is
planned for future inclusion, emphasizing our commitment to continuous
development and innovation.

The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial
for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. This documentation has been
updated to reflect the latest features, enhancements, and the planned
integration of the Consensual Process, ensuring users have access to the most
current and comprehensive information.

## How Memory Systems Empower Agents

  1. : With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.
  2. : Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.
  3. : By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.

## Implementing Memory in Your Crew

When configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to
suit the crew‚Äôs objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform. By default,
the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting in the
crew configuration. The memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you
can change it by setting to a different model. It‚Äôs also possible to initialize
the memory instance with your own instance.

The ‚Äòembedder‚Äô only applies to which uses Chroma for RAG. The uses SQLite3 to
store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage
implementations. The data storage files are saved into a platform-specific
location found using the appdirs package, and the name of the project can be
overridden using the environment variable.

### Example: Configuring Memory for a Crew

```

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities

```

### Example: Use Custom Memory Instances e.g FAISS as the VectorDB

```

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities

```

## Integrating Mem0 for Enhanced User Memory

is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications, enabling personalized AI
experiences.

To include user-specific memory you can get your API key and refer the for
adding user preferences.

```

# Set environment variables for Mem0

# Step 1: Record preferences based on past conversation or user input

     "Hi there! I'm planning a vacation and could use some advice."
     "Hello! I'd be happy to help with your vacation planning. What kind of destination do you prefer?"
     "I am more of a beach person than a mountain person."
     "That's interesting. Do you like hotels or Airbnb?"

# Step 2: Create a Crew with User Memory

```

If you want to access a specific organization and project, you can set the and
parameters in the memory configuration.

### Using OpenAI embeddings (already default)

Alternatively, you can directly pass the OpenAIEmbeddingFunction to the embedder
parameter.

```

# Note: Ensure you have installed and imported `ibm_watsonx_ai` for Watson
embeddings to work.

```

The planning feature in CrewAI allows you to add planning capability to your
crew. When enabled, before each Crew iteration, all Crew information is sent to
an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks step by step, and this plan will be
added to each task description.

Getting started with the planning feature is very easy, the only step required
is to add to your Crew:

```

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities

```

From this point on, your crew will have planning enabled, and the tasks will be
planned before each iteration.

Now you can define the LLM that will be used to plan the tasks.

When running the base case example, you will see something like the output
below, which represents the output of the responsible for creating the step-by-
step logic to add to the Agents‚Äô tasks.

```

  description   "What this tool does. It's vital for effective utilization."

    # Your tool's logic here

```

```

  """Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need
this information to use it."""

   "Result from your custom tool"

```

The class wraps functions as tools, providing flexibility and validation while
reducing boilerplate. It supports custom schemas and dynamic logic for seamless
integration of complex functionalities.

Using , you can wrap a function that interacts with an external API or system,
providing a structured interface. This enables robust validation and consistent
execution, making it easier to integrate complex functionalities into your
applications as demonstrated in the following example:

```

# Define the schema for the tool's input using Pydantic

# Wrapper function to execute the API call

  # Here, you would typically call the API using the parameters

  # For demonstration, we'll return a placeholder string

  
# Create and return the structured tool

    description"A tool to wrap API calls with structured input."

# Execute the tool with structured input

result # Output: Call the API at https://example.com/api with parameters
{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

```

Tools can optionally implement a to fine-tune caching behavior. This function
determines when to cache results based on specific conditions, offering granular
control over caching logic.

```

  """Useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together."""

  # In this case, we only cache the result if it's a multiple of 2

    goal"You write lessons of math for kids."
    backstory"You're an expert in writing and you love to teach kids but you know nothing of math."

```

  * [Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/</how-to/replay-tasks-from-latest-crew-kickoff>)

CrewAI offers a flexible framework for executing tasks in a structured manner,
supporting both sequential and hierarchical processes. This guide outlines how
to effectively implement these processes to ensure efficient task execution and
project completion.

The sequential process ensures tasks are executed one after the other, following
a linear progression. This approach is ideal for projects requiring tasks to be
completed in a specific order.

  * : Ensures orderly progression by handling tasks in a predetermined sequence.
  * : Best suited for projects with clear, step-by-step tasks.
  * : Facilitates easy tracking of task completion and project progress.

To use the sequential process, assemble your crew and define tasks in the order
they need to be executed.

```

 backstory'An experienced researcher with a passion for uncovering insights'

 backstory'A meticulous analyst with a knack for uncovering patterns'

 backstory'A skilled writer with a talent for crafting compelling narratives'

# Form the crew with a sequential process

# Accessing the type-safe output

```

Each task in a sequential process have an agent assigned. Ensure that every
includes an parameter.

  1. : In a sequential process, the first agent completes their task and signals completion.
  2. : Agents pick up their tasks based on the process type, with outcomes of preceding tasks or directives guiding their execution.
  3. : The process concludes once the final task is executed, leading to project completion.

In sequential processes, if an agent has set to , they can delegate tasks to
other agents in the crew. This feature is automatically set up when there are
multiple agents in the crew.

Tasks can be executed asynchronously, allowing for parallel processing when
appropriate. To create an asynchronous task, set when defining the task.

CrewAI supports both memory and caching features:

  * : Enable by setting when creating the Crew. This allows agents to retain information across tasks.
  * : By default, caching is enabled. Set to disable it.

You can set callbacks at both the task and step level:

  * : Executed after each task completion.
  * : Executed after each step in an agent‚Äôs execution.

CrewAI tracks token usage across all tasks and agents. You can access these
metrics after execution.

## Best Practices for Sequential Processes

  1. : Arrange tasks in a logical sequence where each task builds upon the previous one.
  2. : Provide detailed descriptions for each task to guide the agents effectively.
  3. : Match agents‚Äô skills and roles to the requirements of each task.
  4. : Leverage the context from previous tasks to inform subsequent ones.

This updated documentation ensures that details accurately reflect the latest
changes in the codebase and clearly describes how to leverage new features and
configurations. The content is kept simple and direct to ensure easy
understanding.

# Hierarchical Process
URL: https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/hierarchical-process

* [Create Your Own Manager Agent](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/</how-to/custom-manager-agent>)
  * [Force Tool Output as Result](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/</how-to/force-tool-output-as-result>)
  * [Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/</how-to/replay-tasks-from-latest-crew-kickoff>)

The hierarchical process in CrewAI introduces a structured approach to task
management, simulating traditional organizational hierarchies for efficient task
delegation and execution. This systematic workflow enhances project outcomes by
ensuring tasks are handled with optimal efficiency and accuracy.

The hierarchical process is designed to leverage advanced models like GPT-4,
optimizing token usage while handling complex tasks with greater efficiency.

By default, tasks in CrewAI are managed through a sequential process. However,
adopting a hierarchical approach allows for a clear hierarchy in task
management, where a ‚Äòmanager‚Äô agent coordinates the workflow, delegates tasks,
and validates outcomes for streamlined and effective execution. This manager
agent can now be either automatically created by CrewAI or explicitly set by the
user.

  * : A manager agent allocates tasks among crew members based on their roles and capabilities.
  * : The manager evaluates outcomes to ensure they meet the required standards.
  * : Emulates corporate structures, providing an organized approach to task management.
  * : Optionally specify whether the system should use predefined prompts.
  * : Optionally specify whether stop words should be used, supporting various models including the o1 models.
  * : Prioritize important context by enabling respect of the context window, which is now the default behavior.
  * : Delegation is now disabled by default to give users explicit control.
  * : Configurable option to set the maximum number of requests per minute.
  * : Limit the maximum number of iterations for obtaining a final answer.

To utilize the hierarchical process, it‚Äôs essential to explicitly set the
process attribute to , as the default behavior is . Define a crew with a
designated manager and establish a clear chain of command.

Assign tools at the agent level to facilitate task delegation and execution by
the designated agents under the manager‚Äôs guidance. Tools can also be specified
at the task level for precise control over tool availability during task
execution.

Configuring the parameter is crucial for the hierarchical process. The system
requires a manager LLM to be set up for proper function, ensuring tailored
decision-making.

```

# Agents are defined with attributes for backstory, cache, and verbose mode

  backstory'Experienced data analyst with a knack for uncovering hidden trends.'

  # tools=[] # This can be optionally specified; defaults to an empty list

  use_system_prompt # Enable or disable system prompts for this agent

  max_rpm # Limit on the number of requests per minute

  max_iter # Maximum number of iterations for a final answer

  backstory'Creative writer passionate about storytelling in technical domains.'

  # tools=[] # Optionally specify tools; defaults to an empty list

  use_system_prompt # Enable or disable system prompts for this agent

  max_rpm # Limit on the number of requests per minute

  max_iter # Maximum number of iterations for a final answer

# Establishing the crew with a hierarchical process and additional
configurations

  tasks # Tasks to be delegated and executed under the manager's supervision

  manager_llmChatOpenAItemperature model # Mandatory if manager_agent is not set

  processProcesshierarchical # Specifies the hierarchical management approach

  respect_context_window # Enable respect of the context window for tasks

  memory # Enable memory usage for enhanced task execution

  manager_agent # Optional: explicitly set a specific agent as manager instead
of the manager_llm

  planning # Enable planning feature for pre-execution strategy

```

  1. : The manager assigns tasks strategically, considering each agent‚Äôs capabilities and available tools.
  2. : Agents complete their tasks with the option for asynchronous execution and callback functions for streamlined workflows.
  3. : Despite being a hierarchical process, tasks follow a logical order for smooth progression, facilitated by the manager‚Äôs oversight.

Adopting the hierarchical process in CrewAI, with the correct configurations and
understanding of the system‚Äôs capabilities, facilitates an organized and
efficient approach to project management. Utilize the advanced features and
customizations to tailor the workflow to your specific needs, ensuring optimal
task execution and project success.

Crafting an efficient CrewAI team hinges on the ability to dynamically tailor
your AI agents to meet the unique requirements of any project. This section
covers the foundational attributes you can customize.

Specifies the agent‚Äôs job within the crew, such as ‚ÄòAnalyst‚Äô or ‚ÄòCustomer
Service Rep‚Äô.  
---  
Defines the agent‚Äôs objectives, aligned with its role and the crew‚Äôs overarching
mission.  
Provides depth to the agent‚Äôs persona, enhancing motivations and engagements
within the crew.  
Represents the capabilities or methods the agent uses for tasks, from simple
functions to complex integrations.  
Determines if the agent should use a cache for tool usage.  
Sets the maximum requests per minute (). Can be set to for unlimited requests to
external services.  
Enables detailed logging for debugging and optimization, providing insights into
execution processes.  
Controls task delegation to other agents, default is .  
Limits the maximum number of iterations () for a task to prevent infinite loops,
with a default of 25.  
Sets the maximum time allowed for an agent to complete a task.  
Defines the system format for the agent.  
Defines the prompt format for the agent.  
Defines the response format for the agent.  
Controls whether the agent will use a system prompt during task execution.  
Enables a sliding context window by default, maintaining context size.  
Sets the maximum number of retries () for an agent in case of errors.  
Beyond the basic attributes, CrewAI allows for deeper customization to enhance
an agent‚Äôs behavior and capabilities significantly.

Agents can be customized with specific language models () and function-calling
language models (), offering advanced control over their processing and
decision-making abilities. It‚Äôs important to note that setting the allows for
overriding the default crew function-calling language model, providing a greater
degree of customization.

Adjusting an agent‚Äôs performance and monitoring its operations are crucial for
efficient task execution.

### Verbose Mode and RPM Limit

  * : Enables detailed logging of an agent‚Äôs actions, useful for debugging and optimization. Specifically, it provides insights into agent execution processes, aiding in the optimization of performance.
  * : Sets the maximum number of requests per minute (). This attribute is optional and can be set to for no limit, allowing for unlimited queries to external services if needed.

### Maximum Iterations for Task Execution

The attribute allows users to define the maximum number of iterations an agent
can perform for a single task, preventing infinite loops or excessively long
executions. The default value is set to 25, providing a balance between
thoroughness and efficiency. Once the agent approaches this number, it will try
its best to give a good answer.

Agents are customized by defining their attributes and tools during
initialization. Tools are critical for an agent‚Äôs functionality, enabling them
to perform specialized tasks. The attribute should be an array of tools the
agent can utilize, and it‚Äôs initialized as an empty list by default. Tools can
be added or modified post-agent initialization to adapt to new requirements.

### Example: Assigning Tools to an Agent

```

# Set API keys for tool initialization

# Initialize a search tool

# Initialize the agent with advanced options

 backstory'An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.'

 max_rpm # No limit on requests per minute

 max_iter # Default value for maximum iterations

```

Controlling an agent‚Äôs ability to delegate tasks or ask questions is vital for
tailoring its autonomy and collaborative dynamics within the CrewAI framework.
By default, the attribute is now set to , disabling agents to seek assistance or
delegate tasks as needed. This default behavior can be changed to promote
collaborative problem-solving and efficiency within the CrewAI ecosystem. If
needed, delegation can be enabled to suit specific operational requirements.

### Example: Disabling Delegation for an Agent

```

 goal'Write engaging content on market trends'

 backstory'A seasoned writer with expertise in market analysis.'

```

Customizing agents in CrewAI by setting their roles, goals, backstories, and
tools, alongside advanced options like language model customization, memory,
performance settings, and delegation preferences, equips a nuanced and capable
AI team ready for complex challenges.

  * [Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/</how-to/replay-tasks-from-latest-crew-kickoff>)

CrewAI supports multimodal agents that can process both text and non-text
content like images. This guide will show you how to enable and use multimodal
capabilities in your agents.

To create a multimodal agent, simply set the parameter to when initializing your
agent:

```

  goal"Analyze and extract insights from images"

  backstory"An expert in visual content interpretation with years of experience
in image analysis"

  multimodal # This enables multimodal capabilities

```

When you set , the agent is automatically configured with the necessary tools
for handling non-text content, including the .

The multimodal agent comes pre-configured with the , which allows it to process
images. You don‚Äôt need to manually add this tool - it‚Äôs automatically included
when you enable multimodal capabilities.

Here‚Äôs a complete example showing how to use a multimodal agent to analyze an
image:

```

# Create a multimodal agent

  goal"Analyze product images and provide detailed descriptions"

  backstory"Expert in visual product analysis with deep knowledge of design and
features"

# Create a task for image analysis

  description"Analyze the product image at https://example.com/product.jpg and
provide a detailed description"

# Create and run the crew

```

You can provide additional context or specific questions about the image when
creating tasks for multimodal agents. The task description can include specific
aspects you want the agent to focus on:

```

# Create a multimodal agent for detailed analysis

  goal"Perform detailed quality analysis of product images"

  backstory"Senior quality control expert with expertise in visual inspection"

  multimodal # AddImageTool is automatically included

# Create a task with specific analysis requirements

  Analyze the product image at httpsexamplecomproductjpg  focus on

  Provide a detailed report highlighting  issues found

# Create and run the crew

```

When working with multimodal agents, the is automatically configured with the
following schema:

```

  image_url  # Required: The URL or path of the image to process

  action Optional   # Optional: Additional context or specific questions about
the image

```

The multimodal agent will automatically handle the image processing through its
built-in tools, allowing it to:

  * Access images via URLs or local file paths
  * Process image content with optional context or specific questions
  * Provide analysis and insights based on the visual information and task requirements

When working with multimodal agents, keep these best practices in mind:

  1.      * Ensure your images are accessible via URLs that the agent can reach
     * For local images, consider hosting them temporarily or using absolute file paths
     * Verify that image URLs are valid and accessible before running tasks
  2.      * Be specific about what aspects of the image you want the agent to analyze
     * Include clear questions or requirements in the task description
     * Consider using the optional parameter for focused analysis
  3.      * Image processing may require more computational resources than text-only tasks
     * Some language models may require base64 encoding for image data
     * Consider batch processing for multiple images to optimize performance
  4.      * Verify that your environment has the necessary dependencies for image processing
     * Ensure your language model supports multimodal capabilities
     * Test with small images first to validate your setup
  5.      * Implement proper error handling for image loading failures
     * Have fallback strategies for when image processing fails
     * Monitor and log image processing operations for debugging

CrewAI Agents now have the powerful ability to write and execute code,
significantly enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. This feature is
particularly useful for tasks that require computational or programmatic
solutions.

To enable code execution for an agent, set the parameter to when creating the
agent.

```

  goal"Craft well-designed and thought-out code"

  backstory"You are a senior Python developer with extensive experience in
software architecture and best practices."

```

  1. : It is strongly recommended to use more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 when enabling code execution. These models have a better understanding of programming concepts and are more likely to generate correct and efficient code.
  2. : The code execution feature includes error handling. If executed code raises an exception, the agent will receive the error message and can attempt to correct the code or provide alternative solutions. The parameter, which defaults to 2, controls the maximum number of retries for a task.
  3. : To use the code execution feature, you need to install the package. If not installed, the agent will log an info message: ‚ÄúCoding tools not available. Install crewai_tools.‚Äù

When an agent with code execution enabled encounters a task requiring
programming:

The agent analyzes the task and determines that code execution is necessary.

It formulates the Python code needed to solve the problem.

The code is sent to the internal code execution tool ().

The agent interprets the result and incorporates it into its response or uses it
for further problem-solving.

Here‚Äôs a detailed example of creating an agent with code execution capabilities
and using it in a task:

```

# Create an agent with code execution enabled

  goal"Analyze data and provide insights using Python"

  backstory"You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills."

# Create a task that requires code execution

  description"Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of
participants."

# Create a crew and add the task

```

In this example, the can write and execute Python code to perform data analysis
tasks.

In CrewAI, you can force the output of a tool as the result of an agent‚Äôs task.
This feature is useful when you want to ensure that the tool output is captured
and returned as the task result, avoiding any agent modification during the task
execution.

## Forcing Tool Output as Result

To force the tool output as the result of an agent‚Äôs task, you need to set the
parameter to when adding a tool to the agent. This parameter ensures that the
tool output is captured and returned as the task result, without any
modifications by the agent.

Here‚Äôs an example of how to force the tool output as the result of an agent‚Äôs
task:

```

# Create a coding agent with the custom tool

    goal"Produce amazing reports on AI"
    backstory"You work with data and AI"

# Assuming the tool's execution and result population occurs within the system

```

The agent executes the task using the tool provided.

The tool generates the output, which is captured as the task result.

The agent may reflect and take learnings from the tool but the output is not
modified.

The tool output is returned as the task result without any modifications.

## Human input in agent execution

Human input is critical in several agent execution scenarios, allowing agents to
request additional information or clarification when necessary. This feature is
especially useful in complex decision-making processes or when agents require
more details to complete a task effectively.

## Using human input with CrewAI

To integrate human input into agent execution, set the flag in the task
definition. When enabled, the agent prompts the user for input before delivering
its final answer. This input can provide extra context, clarify ambiguities, or
validate the agent‚Äôs output.

  * [Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/</how-to/replay-tasks-from-latest-crew-kickoff>)

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew asynchronously, allowing you to
start the crew execution in a non-blocking manner. This feature is particularly
useful when you want to run multiple crews concurrently or when you need to
perform other tasks while the crew is executing.

To kickoff a crew asynchronously, use the method. This method initiates the crew
execution in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing
other tasks.

  * (dict): A dictionary containing the input data required for the tasks.

  * : An object representing the result of the crew execution.

  * : Kickoff multiple independent crews asynchronously, each responsible for generating content on different topics. For example, one crew might research and draft an article on AI trends, while another crew generates social media posts about a new product launch. Each crew operates independently, allowing content production to scale efficiently.
  * : Launch multiple crews asynchronously to conduct market research in parallel. One crew might analyze industry trends, while another examines competitor strategies, and yet another evaluates consumer sentiment. Each crew independently completes its task, enabling faster and more comprehensive insights.
  * : Execute separate crews to independently plan different aspects of a trip. One crew might handle flight options, another handles accommodation, and a third plans activities. Each crew works asynchronously, allowing various components of the trip to be planned simultaneously and independently for faster results.

## Example: Single Asynchronous Crew Execution

Here‚Äôs an example of how to kickoff a crew asynchronously using asyncio and
awaiting the result:

```

# Create an agent with code execution enabled

  goal"Analyze data and provide insights using Python"

  * [Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff](https://docs.crewai.com/tools/</how-to/replay-tasks-from-latest-crew-kickoff>)

This tool is used to convert natural language to SQL queries. When passsed to
the agent it will generate queries and then use them to interact with the
database.

This enables multiple workflows like having an Agent to access the database
fetch information based on the goal and then use the information to generate a
response, report or any other output. Along with that proivdes the ability for
the Agent to update the database based on its goal.

: Make sure that the Agent has access to a Read-Replica or that is okay for the
Agent to run insert/update queries on the database.

  * Any DB compatible library (e.g. psycopg2, mysql-connector-python)

In order to use the NL2SQLTool, you need to pass the database URI to the tool.
The URI should be in the format .

```

# psycopg2 was installed to run this example with PostgreSQL

```

The primary task goal was:

‚ÄúRetrieve the average, maximum, and minimum monthly revenue for each city, but
only include cities that have more than one user. Also, count the number of user
in each city and sort the results by the average monthly revenue in descending
order‚Äù

So the Agent tried to get information from the DB, the first one is wrong so the
Agent tries again and gets the correct information and passes to the next agent.

The second task goal was:

‚ÄúReview the data and create a detailed report, and then create the table on the
database with the fields based on the data provided. Include information on the
average, maximum, and minimum monthly revenue for each city, but only include
cities that have more than one user. Also, count the number of users in each
city and sort the results by the average monthly revenue in descending order.‚Äù

Now things start to get interesting, the Agent generates the SQL query to not
only create the table but also insert the data into the table. And in the end
the Agent still returns the final report which is exactly what was in the
database.

This is a simple example of how the NL2SQLTool can be used to interact with the
database and generate reports based on the data in the database.

The Tool provides endless possibilities on the logic of the Agent and how it can
interact with the database.

```

 DB -> Agent -> ... -> Agent -> DB

The WebsiteSearchTool is currently in an experimental phase. We are actively
working on incorporating this tool into our suite of offerings and will update
the documentation accordingly.

The WebsiteSearchTool is designed as a concept for conducting semantic searches
within the content of websites. It aims to leverage advanced machine learning
models like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to navigate and extract
information from specified URLs efficiently. This tool intends to offer
flexibility, allowing users to perform searches across any website or focus on
specific websites of interest. Please note, the current implementation details
of the WebsiteSearchTool are under development, and its functionalities as
described may not yet be accessible.

To prepare your environment for when the WebsiteSearchTool becomes available,
you can install the foundational package with:

This command installs the necessary dependencies to ensure that once the tool is
fully integrated, users can start using it immediately.

Below are examples of how the WebsiteSearchTool could be utilized in different
scenarios. Please note, these examples are illustrative and represent planned
functionality:

```

# Example of initiating tool that agents can use

# to search across any discovered websites

# Example of limiting the search to the content of a specific website,

# so now agents can only search within that website

```

  * : An optional argument intended to specify the website URL for focused searches. This argument is designed to enhance the tool‚Äôs flexibility by allowing targeted searches when necessary.

By default, the tool uses OpenAI for both embeddings and summarization. To
customize the model, you can use a config dictionary as follows:

```

      provider # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ...

      provider # or openai, ollama, ...

The XMLSearchTool is a cutting-edge RAG tool engineered for conducting semantic
searches within XML files. Ideal for users needing to parse and extract
information from XML content efficiently, this tool supports inputting a search
query and an optional XML file path. By specifying an XML path, users can target
their search more precisely to the content of that file, thereby obtaining more
relevant search outcomes.

To start using the XMLSearchTool, you must first install the crewai_tools
package. This can be easily done with the following command:

Here are two examples demonstrating how to use the XMLSearchTool. The first
example shows searching within a specific XML file, while the second example
illustrates initiating a search without predefining an XML path, providing
flexibility in search scope.

```

# Allow agents to search within any XML file's content

#as it learns about their paths during execution

# Initialize the tool with a specific XML file path

#for exclusive search within that document

```

  * : This is the path to the XML file you wish to search. It is an optional parameter during the tool‚Äôs initialization but must be provided either at initialization or as part of the method‚Äôs arguments to execute a search.

By default, the tool uses OpenAI for both embeddings and summarization. To
customize the model, you can use a config dictionary as follows:

```

      provider # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ...

      provider # or openai, ollama, ...

This tool is designed to perform semantic searches within a specific Youtube
channel‚Äôs content. Leveraging the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
methodology, it provides relevant search results, making it invaluable for
extracting information or finding specific content without the need to manually
sift through videos. It streamlines the search process within Youtube channels,
catering to researchers, content creators, and viewers seeking specific
information or topics.

To utilize the YoutubeChannelSearchTool, the package must be installed. Execute
the following command in your shell to install:

To begin using the YoutubeChannelSearchTool, follow the example below. This
demonstrates initializing the tool with a specific Youtube channel handle and
conducting a search within that channel‚Äôs content.

```

# Initialize the tool to search within any Youtube channel's content the agent
learns about during its execution

# Initialize the tool with a specific Youtube channel handle to target your
search

```

  * : A mandatory string representing the Youtube channel handle. This parameter is crucial for initializing the tool to specify the channel you want to search within. The tool is designed to only search within the content of the provided channel handle.

By default, the tool uses OpenAI for both embeddings and summarization. To
customize the model, you can use a config dictionary as follows:

```

      provider # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ...

      provider # or openai, ollama, ...
